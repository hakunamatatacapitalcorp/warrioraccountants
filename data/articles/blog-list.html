          <p>With Uber, we’re excited to be the first mobile wallet to deeply integrate with their new<a href="https://www.uber.com/signup/ride/androidpay">Payment Rewards</a>&nbsp;program, which allows users to unlock timely discounts. Starting today through
            October 15, all Android Pay users in the U.S. can enjoy&nbsp;<a href="http://android.com/pay/promotions/uber">50% off 10 Uber rides</a>.* No codes, no hassle – just use Android Pay on Uber to get your discounted rides.</p>
          <h3>More checkouts made simple<br></h3>
          <p>We’re moving beyond mobile apps and bringing the simplicity and security of Android Pay onto the mobile web. Users will soon be able to speed through mobile checkout on Chrome using Android Pay on sites like Groupon.com, 1-800-Flowers.com and
            many more to come. Just like in stores and in apps, Android Pay does not share actual account numbers with merchants, so users can shop online with confidence, knowing that Android Pay keeps their card number secure.</p>
          <p>We’re looking forward to bringing Android Pay to more countries, more banks, and more of your favorite stores, sites, and apps. Stay tuned for more updates soon.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>*<a href="https://www.android.com/pay/promotions/uber/terms-and-conditions/">Merchant terms apply</a><br></p>
