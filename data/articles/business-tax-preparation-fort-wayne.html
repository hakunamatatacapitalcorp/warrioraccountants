        <blockquote>Let’s be clear and simple.</blockquote>

        <div class="rich-text">Getting the most tax efficient results entails monitoring your books and financials throughout the year. NOT just at tax time. If you have the proper approach tax planning takes place during the year. Come the next year preparing a tax return is strictly a matter of ‘compliance’, following the rules and laws. Which also results in less tax fines and penalties.

      <div class="uni-paragraph">
        <div class="rich-text">You should never be filing a late tax return and if you are someone has failed. It may be you. It may be no leadership from your accountant. No judgment but it’s time to move up to a better standard.
