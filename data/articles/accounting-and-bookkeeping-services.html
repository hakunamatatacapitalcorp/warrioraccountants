            <li>“What are you looking for in a good accounting service?”</li>
            <li>Sometimes we hear that our new customers paid unexpected taxes last year.</li>
            <li>Sometimes we hear our new customers don't have good communication with their accountant.</li>
            <li>Sometimes we hear our new customers say their accountant wasn’t up with technology.</li>
            <li>"What does your accountant do for you?"</li>
            <li>We firmly believe your accountant should see your books and financials regularly. Imagine only seeing your dentist when you have a broken tooth. Or only seeing your mechanic when you have a breakdown. Our successful clients adopt our recommended maintenance program.</li>
            <li>"Do you know what your financials mean? How is your accountant helping you to understand these numbers?" It’s as important as checking your oil.</li>
            <li>"Do you talk to your accountant when trying to make financial decisions (i.e. buying equipment, vehicles, buildings, etc.)?”</li>
            <li>If your accountant collaborates and has access to your books and financials what better resource for making informed decisions?</li>
            <li>"How often do you see or talk to your accountant?”</li>
            <li>We think you should have regular meaningful communication with your accounting team</li>
            <li>"How do you feel a good accounting service could help your business?”</li>
            <li>"Is your current service doing that?"</li>
