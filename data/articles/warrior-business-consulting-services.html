          <p>We’ve established on other pages that having up to date books and financials is important to knowing where you are at, controlling how much tax you pay, and complying with the law. All that is founded in the foundation of best practices keeping things clean regularly, weekly and maybe daily. But what if you are thinking about a major decision? Should you purchase a new division, and how would that look as a new company? Can you afford to open a second location? What can you work on to improve profits? These are the types of things that are more sophisticated but might be challenging to make the right decision without the leadership you need. Experience and leaderhsip makes all the difference here.</p>
