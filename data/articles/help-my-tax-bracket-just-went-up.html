My tax bracket just went up!</a></h1> <blockquote> <p>An illustration of how tax brackets work, by CPA Dan Hodges**</p> </blockquote> <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnRPwU8SbZk" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p>Should you be worried if you jump brackets? No not necessarily. It just means that additional income is taxed at that next rate. But contrary to urban myth the next rate does NOT apply to your entire income!</p> <p>For 2017 current tax rates are 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%.</p> <p>Under HR1 Congress proposed only 4 brackets for the future which we 12%, 25%, 35%, and 39.6%. Senate mixes things up by expanding the number brackets and changing rates to 10%, 12%, 22.5%, 25%, 32.5%, 35% and 38.5%.</p> <p>Bottom line, donâ€™t be worried! Any rate reduction is probably not a bad thing, if you believe you are a better steward of resources than the government.</p>
